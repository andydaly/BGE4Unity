# Games Engines 2 Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to recreate a classic space battle using the game AI techniques you are learning on the course. Your assignment should tell a story and as much as possible, the behaviours of the ships should be programmed rather than using any built in stuff in Unity. If you dont like sci-fi, then a nature simulation is also cool. Try and avoid Star Wars because itâ€™s been done to death, but if you really want to do Star Wars, you can. I suggest you pick classic sci-fi such as any of the following:

- 2001 A Space Odyssey
- Buck Rogers in the 25th Centuary
- Space 1999
- UFO
- Battle of the Planets
- Star Trek
- Darkstar
- The Last Starfighter
- Battlestar Galactica

Here are some previous assignments you can use for inspiration:

Use any game engine you like (including any game engine you might be ), but most people use Unity3D

## Interm assignment
This is due on 17 February 2015 and worth 10% (not graded). You must submit:
- Git repo link to...
- A project where you have all your assets imported (models etc)
- A scene with some space ships
- One of your ships should implement a path following behaviour
- A storyboard for the story in your assignment laying out the different scenes, cameras and behaviours.

The main assignment is due 14 April 2015

Rubric (work in progress!):

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Your animat works and moves realistically. You make a pull request to BGE and it's accepted meaning you your code is good enough to be used by next years students. You have lots of different joint types and have figured out how to put appropriate limits on the joints so that they are realistic. The problem you solved was challenging and required a lot of figuring out. You have created new classes to abstract the complexity of your assignment. Your assignment has a lot of novelty and is impressive looking |
| 2.1 | Your animat works and moves with some minor issues. You have used a 2-3 joint types with no limits put on the joints. You have used just 1-2 rigid body shapes. The animat/thing you make is about as complicated as a [Watt beam engine](http://www.animatedengines.com/watt.html). You dont use any other controllers or tried to use a controller but couldnt get it working. Code is in functions and no new classes required.|
| 2.2 | Your animat doesnt move by itself. Your assignment is some rigid bodies connected by hinge joints or one joint type. Your assignmnet is about as complicated as a 4 wheeled cart. Everything is in one or two functions. |
| Pass | No animat. There are no joints, just some rigid bodies. Simple changes to to the PhysicsGame or SceneGraphGame code. |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. Little or no code changes to the supplied code. |
